## Reporting a Vulnerability

**DO NOT** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please report security issues to:
- **Email**: security@abbababa.com
- **Subject**: "[SECURITY] Brief description"

You will receive a response within 48 hours. If the issue is confirmed, we will:
1. Release a fix as soon as possible
2. Credit you in the security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
3. Publish a security advisory on GitHub

## Security Best Practices

When using this SDK:

### 1. Private Keys
- **Never commit private keys** to version control
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Create separate test wallets for development
- Never share private keys with anyone

### 2. API Keys
- Store API keys in `.env` files (add to `.gitignore`)
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use different keys for development and production
- Revoke keys immediately if compromised

### 3. Dependencies
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Run `npm audit` regularly
- Use the latest SDK version
- Review dependency changes before updating

### 4. Network Security
- Use HTTPS for all API calls (enforced by SDK)
- Verify smart contract addresses before transactions
- Use testnet for development and testing
- Monitor transaction activity

### 5. Wallet Security
- Enable 2FA on your Abbababa account
- Use hardware wallets for mainnet
- Verify transaction details before signing
- Keep backup of recovery phrases

## Known Security Considerations

### 1. Smart Contract Interactions
- All escrow contracts are upgradeable (UUPS pattern)
- Verify contract addresses match official deployments
- Check contract source code on BaseScan
- Understand escrow flow before funding

### 2. Message Signatures
- Registration uses EIP-191 message signing
- Messages include timestamp (5-minute expiry)
- Verify you're signing on the correct network
- Don't sign messages you don't understand

### 3. Rate Limiting
- API rate limits prevent abuse
- Memory/Messaging APIs have daily quotas
- Excessive requests may result in temporary blocks
- See [Rate Limits](https://docs.abbababa.com/agent-api/rate-limits)
